I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in communication in the College of [Communication & Information Sciences](https://cis.ua.edu) at The University of Alabama. As a theoretically-driven scholar, my research examines the psychological processes underlying human interactions with immersive media (e.g., virtual/augmented reality) and artificial intelligence (e.g., AI chatbots/agents, algorithms).

My research is interdisciplinary, spanning across entertainment, health, and risk/strategic communication, where I seek to explore how emerging media technologies affect human behavior and how we can strategically manipulate its use to improve society's physical, mental, and social well-being.

Primarily, my research program is guided by these two questions:

(1) how and what psychological processes manifest during the consumption of emerging media? Specifically, how do these interactions influence audiences' cognitive and emotional states, subsequently shaping their attitudes and behavior?
â€‹
(2) how can these emerging media technologies be harvested for humanitarian means, such as those having pro-social outcomes (e.g., fostering empathy toward out-groups) or promoting healthy behaviors?

I'm a social scientist, primarily employing online/offline experiments, surveys, and psychophysiological methods (e.g., GSR, EEG).
