I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in communication in the [College of Communication & Information Sciences](https://cis.ua.edu) at [The University of Alabama](https://ua.edu). As a theoretically-driven scholar, my research examines the psychological processes underlying human interactions with **immersive media** (e.g., virtual/augmented reality) and **artificial intelligence** (e.g., AI chatbots/agents, algorithms). Applying theoretical insights from cognitive psychology, social psychology, and communication science, I attempt to understand how these technologies shape users' cognitive and emotional states. 

My research is interdisciplinary, spanning across entertainment, health, and risk/strategic communication, where I seek to explore how emerging media technologies affect human behavior and how we can strategically manipulate its use to improve society's physical, mental, and social well-being.

Primarily, my research program is guided by these two questions:

**(1)** How and what psychological processes manifest during the consumption of emerging media? Specifically, how do these interactions influence audiences' cognitive and emotional states, subsequently shaping their attitudes and behavior?
â€‹
**(2)** How can these emerging media technologies be harvested for humanitarian means, such as those having pro-social outcomes (e.g., fostering empathy toward out-groups) or promoting healthy behaviors?

A sample of my current projects: (_1_) examining the role of social presence in cognitively and emotionally processing deepfakes in the metaverse, (_2_) investigating how the influence of misinformation in the metaverse is shaped by agency (i.e., human vs. AI) and relational closeness, (_3_) role of augmented reality in promoting prosocial behaviors, (_4_) influence of algorithmically-generated advertisements on heuristic processes, and (_5_) effect of AI-influencers' characteristics on parasocial interaction and brand engagement. For a complete list of current and past projects, please visit my [research](https://s-mikkilineni.github.io/Research/) page.

I'm a social scientist, primarily employing online/offline experiments, surveys, and psychophysiological methods (e.g., GSR, EEG).
